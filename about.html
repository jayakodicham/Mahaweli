                        <p class="lead"> This section will provide a comprehensive, historical overview of the AMDP. The Mahaweli River is the longest river in Sri Lanka that runs 208 miles, starting from the central highlands and flows across the country until it reaches the Bay of Bengal on the southwestern side of Trincomalee Bay.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> It carries the largest volume of water amounting to one seventh of Sri Lanka's total runoff and has a basin that covers 15 percent of the country's land. The Accelerated Mahaweli Development program is the largest multipurpose national development program in the history of Sri Lanka  which was initiated in 1961. This project was aimed at  large-scale development of the Mahaweli basin in a number of directions including agricultural production, irrigation systems, resettlement of people, and flood mitigation. Mapping Mahaweli is a website that features a digital map that archives the historical milestones of  the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project since 1961.<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>  The project is aimed at digitizing the historical documents to help users understand the history of the shaping of the Mahaweli river through the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project. It will also provide a platform for the users to understand technopolitics of a river based development project which is often framed as a development machine to bring in prosperity.</p>
