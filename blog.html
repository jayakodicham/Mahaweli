                            <p class="fs-10 mb-4">Sitting on a broken damro plastic chair, 68 years old started telling me about his illness. “They are telling us it is caused by the water we drink. But no one tells us what’s wrong with the water and what caused water go bad,” Gurunnnase, a 68 year-old man, who used to farm acres of rice fields and lead the village’s hewisi team told me when I asked what he thinks causes this kideny disease. His name is Rala, but everyone in the village called him Gurunnanse. He used to play all the musical instruments back in the days at temple, funerals, religious functions, and has trained many children. In other words, he was the teacher of many generations of hewisi groups in Meegahayaya. “I have many golayos (students). Now I have stopped everything, I don’t have the energy”, he says and walks inside the house and brings a plastic chair for me. “Oh, you don’t have to do that, I can sit here, by the steps.” He gives ne the chair anyways. While drawing the chair closer to him, I asked him what he thinks could be the cause of this kideny illness. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as we know it are everywhere, so there's no reason to think that Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we find that.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large enough and carry enough energy into our system to disrupt transportation, communication, the food chains, and that can be a really bad day on Earth.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who might be interested.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know what happened there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had running water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.</p>
