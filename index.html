                        <p class="lead">This is the sample text which introduces the user to the web project-- what it includes, why it's important etc. Mapping Mahaweli is a website that features a digital map that archives the historical milestones of  the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project since 1961. The project is aimed at digitizing the historical documents to help users understand the history of the shaping of the Mahaweli river through the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project. It will also provide a platform for the users to understand technopolitics of a river based development project which is often framed as a development machine to bring in prosperity. Particularly, “Mahaweli Memories” provides the users information on various outcomes, and social issues that emerged over the time as a result of this development project.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The proposed project titled, Mapping Mahaweli is a website that features a digital map that archives the historical milestones of  the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project since 1961. This website is significant at least because of two main reasons. First, Most of the archival documents are housed as physical documents or artifacts within institutions such as the University of Peradeniya library and museum of the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority. The project is aimed at digitizing the historical documents to help users understand the history of the shaping of the Mahaweli river through the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project. Second, it will provide a platform for the users to understand technopolitics of a river based development project which is often framed as a development machine to bring in prosperity. Particularly, the sub page of the website titled “Mahaweli Memories” provides the users information on various outcomes, and social issues that emerged over the time as a result of this development project. This information will come from archival data (e.g., newspaper articles) and stories people tell about their experiences around this development project.  This website and the map embedded in the website will be the first comprehensive digital platform that documents the history of Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project  and its sociopolitical tensions.</p>
